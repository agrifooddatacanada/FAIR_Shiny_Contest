# 🌟📊

### A. Scoring

#### 1. Technical Merit (35%) 🛠️

- **0-1**: ❌ Undefined or poorly defined goals, unclear audience, ineffective design, overly simple or complex, unintuitive UI, unclear visualizations.
- **2-3**: ⚠️ Somewhat clear goals, identifiable audience, somewhat effective design, appropriate complexity, mostly intuitive UI, generally clear visualizations.
- **4-5**: ✅ Clearly defined goals, well-identified audience, effective design, appropriate complexity, intuitive UI, clear and informative visualizations.

#### 2. Reproducibility (35%) 🔄

- **0-1**: ❌ Data not available or not FAIR, no documentation, source code poorly documented and steps difficult to understand.
- **2-3**: ⚠️ Data partially available or somewhat FAIR, basic documentation, source code available but fairly documented, notes somehow difficult to follow.
- **4-5**: ✅ Data fully available and FAIR, comprehensive documentation, well-documented source code available, notes clear and steps easy to follow.

#### 3. Artistic Design (30%) 🎨

- **0-1**: ❌ UI too busy or too simple, not visually appealing.
- **2-3**: ⚠️ UI somewhat appropriate, moderately visually appealing.
- **4-5**: ✅ UI well-suited to the audience, highly visually appealing.

Each category should be scored independently, and the final evaluation should consider the weighed score across all categories to determine the overall effectiveness and quality of the Shiny app.

### B. Components Explanation

#### 1. Technical Merit 🛠️

**Goal and Audience**

- **Clarity of Purpose**: Is the main goal of the app clearly defined? 🎯
- **Target Audience**: Is the target audience identified and appropriately addressed? 👥

**Design and Functionality**

- **Effectiveness of Design**: Does the design effectively accomplish the app’s goals? 🎨
- **Complexity**: Is the app appropriately complex for its purpose (neither too simple nor unnecessarily complicated)? ⚙️
- **User Interface (UI)**: Is the UI intuitive and user-friendly? 🖥️
- **Visualization**: Are the visualizations clear, informative, and relevant to the app’s goals? 📊

#### 2. Reproducibility 🔄

**Data Availability**

- **FAIR Data Principles**: Is the data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)? 🔍

**Documentation and Transparency**

- **Documentation**: Is there a comprehensive documentation page or tab that explains the app’s functionalities and usage? 📄
- **Source Code Availability**: Is the source code available (e.g., on GitHub) and well-documented? 💻

#### 3. Artistic Design 🎨

**Visual Appeal**

- **Appropriateness for Audience**: Is the user interface visually appealing without being too busy or too simple for the intended audience? 👀
- **Aesthetic Quality**: Is the overall design aesthetically pleasing? 🌟
